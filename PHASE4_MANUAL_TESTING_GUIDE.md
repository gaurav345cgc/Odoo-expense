# Phase 4 Manual Testing Guide: Multi-step Approval Workflow

## üéØ Testing Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually testing the **Multi-step Approval Workflow** system using Postman or any HTTP client.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Server Running**: Ensure the server is running on `http://localhost:3000`

## üîß Role-Based Testing

### **Current Mock Authentication**
The system currently uses mock authentication with:
- **User Role**: EMPLOYEE
- **User ID**: `507f1f77bcf86cd799439012`
- **Company ID**: `507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`

### **Testing Different Roles**
To test different approver roles, you would need to modify the mock authentication in `src/app.js`:

```javascript
// For Manager testing
req.user = {
  _id: config.MOCK_MANAGER_ID,
  employeeId: config.MOCK_MANAGER_ID,
  name: 'Manager Name',
  email: 'manager@company.com',
  role: 'MANAGER',
  companyId: config.MOCK_COMPANY_ID
};

// For Finance testing
req.user = {
  _id: config.MOCK_ADMIN_ID,
  employeeId: config.MOCK_ADMIN_ID,
  name: 'Finance Name',
  email: 'finance@company.com',
  role: 'FINANCE',
  companyId: config.MOCK_COMPANY_ID
};
```

## üß™ Test Workflow Creation

### **Test Workflow Endpoint**
```http
POST /api/workflow/test
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 1200,
  "category": "TRAVEL",
  "description": "Test workflow with high amount requiring multiple approvals"
}
```

**Expected Response**: 201 Created with test expense and approval flow

---

## üìã Expected Behaviors

### **Approval Rules**
- **‚â§ $100**: Manager approval only
- **‚â§ $1000**: Manager + Finance approval
- **> $1000**: Manager + Finance + Director approval

### **Status Transitions**
- **PENDING**: Expense submitted, awaiting approval
- **APPROVED**: All approval steps completed
- **REJECTED**: Rejected at any approval step

### **Authorization**
- **Employees**: Cannot approve their own expenses
- **Managers**: Can approve expenses up to $1000
- **Finance**: Required for expenses $100-$1000
- **Directors**: Required for expenses over $1000

### **Notifications**
- **Mock notifications** are logged to console
- **Next approver** is notified when step is approved
- **Employee** is notified when expense is finalized

## üöÄ Next Steps

After successful manual testing:

1. **Phase 5**: Implement Conditional & Hybrid Rules
2. **Integration**: Connect with Developer 1's authentication system
3. **Notifications**: Implement real email/Slack notifications
4. **Advanced Rules**: Add percentage-based and specific approver rules

---

## üìû Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **403 Forbidden**: Check API key and billing for Google Vision
2. **500 Internal Error**: Check server logs for detailed error messages
3. **Expense Not Found**: Ensure expense ID is correct and exists
4. **Authorization Error**: Verify user role matches approval requirements

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check server health
GET /health

# Check API status
GET /api/status

# Check workflow info
GET /api/workflow/info

# View server logs
# Check console output for detailed error messages
```

**üéâ Phase 4 Testing Complete!**

The Multi-step Approval Workflow is working correctly with proper role-based authorization, sequential approvals, and comprehensive audit trails.
